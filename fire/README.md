#FIRE!

This is still a "work in progress". As of this moment, the userscript does not send any feedback, so it's safe to click around a bit.

# TODO:
* ___Update report data on WS message instead of overriding it___
  *  Make it a MS api call?
* ___Implement MS feedback___
* ___Implement SE flags___
* Make FIRE independent of AIM.
* Store user configuration (API keys?)
* Option to disable blur
* Site name is parsed from the post URL. This has to be done.
