#FIRE!

This is still a "work in progress". As of this moment, the userscript does not send any feedback, so it's safe to click around a bit.

# TODO:
* ___Implement MS feedback___
* ___Implement SE flags___
* Add FIRE buttons when more (older) messages are loaded.
* Store user configuration. (API keys, options)
* Option to disable blur.
* Site name is parsed from the post URL. This has to be done differently.
