# ðŸ”¥ FIRE!

This is still a "work in progress".  
As of this moment, the userscript does post flags _and_ MS feedback.

# TODO:
* ___Implement MS feedback error handling___
* ___Handle write token request errors___
  * Handle expired / invalid write tokens.
* Disable / Highlight feedback buttons depending on (earlier) submitted feedback / flags.
* Detect if a user has flagged the post already

Basically, now you can _"KILL IT WITH FIRE"_
