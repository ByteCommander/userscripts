This is still a "work in progress". As of this moment, the userscript does not send any flags, but _does_ sent MS feedback.

# TODO:
* ___Implement MS feedback error handling___
* ___Implement SE flags___
* ___Handle write token request errors___
  * Handle expired / invalid write tokens.
* Site name is parsed from the post URL. This has to be done differently.
* Disable / Highlight feedback buttons depending on (earlier) submitted feedback.
