# TODO:
* ___Re-structure document___
  * Wrap similar functions in objecs, like `popups.openSettings()`
* Load data through metapi.js for cross-script storage;
* Improve MS feedback error handling
  * Respect passed "Backoff" params
* Handle write token request errors
* Detect if a user has flagged the post already:
  * Detect flags not sent through MS
* Improve popup creation:
  * Popups are basically hard-coded. Load (external?) HTML?

Basically, now you can _"KILL IT WITH FIRE"_
