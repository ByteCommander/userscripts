# TODO:
* Re-structure document
  * Wrap similar functions in objects, like `popups.openSettings()`
* Move "why" block up.
* Add "Rude/Abusive" button:
  * Implement SE "rude" feedback.
* Load data through metapi.js for cross-script storage. &diams;
* Improve MS feedback error handling.
  * Respect passed "Backoff" params. &diams;
* "Open last report that needs action" keyboard shortcut. &diams;
* Handle write token request errors.
* Improve popup creation:
  * Load (external?) HTML?
  * Use template (HTML) strings?
  * Popup class that accepts body as parameter.
* Write JSDoc for functions.
* Ask for confirmation if I click "spam" or "rude" on a post which has been edited.

Points marked with &diams; are related to the "loading" rewrite.

Basically, now you can _"KILL IT WITH FIRE"_
